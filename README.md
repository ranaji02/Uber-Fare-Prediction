# Uber-Fare-Prediction
The main objective of project is to design an algorithm which will tell the fare to be charged for a passenger. Machine learning algorithms are used to develop a regression model.

Problem Statement : The project is about on world's largest taxi company Uber inc. In these project we're looking to predict the fare for their future transactional cases. And this company deliever services to lakhs of customers daily. Now it becomes really important to manage their data properly to come up with new business ideas to get best results. So, it becomes really important to estimate the fare prices accurately.

Predict the price of the Uber ride from a given pickup point to the agreed drop-off location. Perform following tasks:

Pre-process the dataset.
Identify outliers.
Check the correlation.
Implement linear regression and random forest regression models.
Evaluate the models and compare their respective scores like R2, RMSE, etc.
